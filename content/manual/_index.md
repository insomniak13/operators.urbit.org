Welcome to the Operator's Manual for the Urbit project. This documentation is
maintained by [Tlon](https://tlon.io) and the Urbit community in a public
[Github repository](https://github.com/urbit/operators.urbit.org). Issues and
contributions are welcome.

This documentation provides a series of guides and reference material for
assisting you in the usage and operations of your ship. If you're looking for
documentation on how to _develop_ on Urbit, see our [development docs](https://developers.urbit.org/).

### [Urbit OS](/manual/os/)

This section describes how to interact with your running Urbit ship: this
includes working with the filesystem, command line (`dojo`), resolving common
issues, and more.

### [Urbit ID](/manual/id/)

Urbit ID is our [public-key infrastructure](/manual/id/overview), which is
what allows you to truly own your identity. Here you'll find guides for
interacting with your Urbit ID via our [Bridge](https://bridge.urbit.org)
application.

### [Running Urbit](/manual/running/)

Urbit can be run in a variety of contexts. Our [Getting Started
Guide](https://urbit.org/getting-started/) covers how to run an Urbit locally on your
computer; this section covers alternative ways of running Urbit.
